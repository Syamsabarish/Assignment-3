  This project is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts Amazon delivery times based on multiple real-world factors such as weather, traffic, order timing, delivery distance, and more. Built using Streamlit, the app provides an interactive interface where users can input delivery-related details and receive an estimated delivery time instantly.
Frontend: Streamlit (for UI)
Backend: Python
Model: XGBoost Regressor
Geospatial Calculation: geopy (great-circle distance)
Model Serialization: joblib
